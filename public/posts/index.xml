      <description>Forum I have decided to take down the forum for now. While I got traffic to the site while trying to talk about it, I didn&amp;rsquo;t get people to sign up.&#xA;That is fine. When we decided to start this thing I knew it would be tough, what I didn&amp;rsquo;t account for was how little IT people like to talk to others.&#xA;What&amp;rsquo;s going to happen? I decided I am just going to post my how-to&amp;rsquo;s and things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned.</description>
