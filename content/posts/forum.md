# Forum

I have decided to take down the forum for now. While I got traffic to the site while trying to talk about it, I didn't get people to sign up.

That is fine. When we decided to start this thing I knew it would be tough, what I didn't account for was how little IT people like to talk to others. 

## What's going to happen?

I decided I am just going to post my how-to's and things I've learned. It isn't much but hopefully someone can learn from the things/mistakes I do.

If there gets to be enough traffic with just the blog, maybe I will bring back the forum or a Matrix room.
